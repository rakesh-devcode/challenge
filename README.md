# Challenge 1
Download full code of challenge 1 including files and script.
Just run the script and you will get the absolute path of all files where "TODO" is there.
I ran in path : C:/Users/user1/Desktop/challenge/challenge1
To run the script in windows: - just go to directory(Python must be installed in your system)
use python ./script.py

Output looks like as like below.

C:/Users/user1/Desktop/challenge/challenge1/somedir/somemodule/somefile.js
C:/Users/user1/Desktop/challenge/challenge1/somedir/somemodule/someotherfile.js
C:/Users/user1/Desktop/challenge/challenge1/somedir2/index.js
C:/Users/user1/Desktop/challenge/challenge1/somedir2/anotherdir/index.js
C:/Users/user1/Desktop/challenge/challenge1/somedir2/anotherdir/yet_another_dir/index.js
C:/Users/user1/Desktop/challenge/challenge1/somedir3/another_file.js
